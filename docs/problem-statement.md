# Problem Statement: easy data mining

With the explosion of data volume and availability, users are
transitioning their focus to analysis and data-mining on these vast
datasets. We believe MongoDB is ideally positioned to provide the
backbone to meet these market needs. While several users have already
begun to exploit this, it requires substantial sunk costs including
mapping the aggregation framework to their current mental model,
designing efficient schemas, and acquiring datasets for prototyping.
Work to humanize the aggregation framework is already underway. We
believe supplying users with example schemas for common use cases,
such as user activity streams, time series data, and entity management,
and more importantly, corresponding datasets for prototyping will
establish MongoDB as a leader in this emerging market.

## Milestones

- [ ] Collect example schemas from documentation
- [ ] Generate random data to populate the example schemas
- [ ] Select datasets to add support for prototyping
- [ ] Design efficient schemas for the selected datasets
- [ ] Scripts to import from data sources to specified user database
